From this, we can see that there are many female characters in these novels that have enough prevelance to become some of the top bigrams.\nThrough this document, we can observe the different uses of romance and sci-fi, as well as their differing nuances that is unique to their respective genre. This method was mostly trying to obtain the main idea of the books, through the use of their vocab. We can then see trends of these words, and possibly try to predict the different story, or at the very least see how they compare to another genre."
